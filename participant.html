            <h1>Online Consent Form for Scrolling Test</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This test is part of a research study conducted by undergraduate student Fatima Yousaf 
                working with Prof. Brad Myers at Carnegie Mellon University. 
            </p>
 
            <p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                In this study, you will use multiple scrolling mechanisms you may or may not be familiar with using 
                a new web-based test program. We hope to gain knowledge about the speed and accuracy of different
                scrolling techniques and the appropriate ways to measure them.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <h4>Purpose of this Study</h4>
                The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of different scrolling techniques 
                through a new web-based test program. The data collected in this study will be used to 
                develop an appropriate empirical testing framework and metrics for scrolling and formulate a 
                mathematical model of scrolling.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <h4>Procedures</h4>
                After signaling that you agree to this consent form, you will be shown the scrolling test program, 
                and will get to practice moving up and down using one or more scrolling devices and techniques. 
                After performing multiple trials with one device, you will optionally be given a rest, 
                and then potentially use another device, or another form of the scrolling test software.
                When all the trials are finished, you will answer a questionnaire about your experience and demographics. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Risks</h4>
                The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those 
                ordinarily encountered in daily life or during browsing online information.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received 
                may be of value to humanity. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Compensation & Costs</h4>
                The compensation for participation in this study is $10.  There will be no cost to you if you participate 
                in this study. You will be paid at the end through an Amazon gift card.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Future Use of Information</h4>
                In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for 
                our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other investigators for their research studies.  
                We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you (or your legally authorized representative).  
                Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                By participating in the study, you understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon may be required to disclose your 
                consent form, data and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or 
                court order.  Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in the following manner: <br/><br/>

                Your data and consent form will be kept separate. Your research data will be stored in a secure manner.
                By participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered 
                during this study may be used by Carnegie Mellon and published and/or disclosed by Carnegie Mellon to others 
                outside of Carnegie Mellon.  However, your name, address, contact information and other direct personal 
                identifiers will not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data and/or 
                results by Carnegie Mellon.  Note that per regulation all research data must be kept for a minimum of 3 years. <br/><br/>

                Subjects' anonymity will be maintained during data analysis and presentation of results by any or all of the 
                following means: (1) subjects will be assigned a number. (2) The researchers will store the data files by subjects' 
                numbers. (3) Only members of the research group will view collected data in detail. (4) Any files will be stored in 
                a secured manner accessed only by members of the research group. (5) The participants can examine the data before 
                submitting it to make sure any information that can identify the participants in their annotations may be removed.
